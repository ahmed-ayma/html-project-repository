        <p>In computer science, in contrast to the natural intelligence exhibited by humans and animals, artificial intelligence ( AI), also called machine intelligence, is intelligence displayed by machines. Leading AI textbooks describe the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any system perceiving its environment and taking action that maximizes its chance to achieve its goals successfully. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is also used to describe devices (or computers) that imitate "cognitive" functions that people associate with the human mind, such as thinking and problem solving.</p>
